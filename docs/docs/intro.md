### Architecture
Anatolio is designed to be modular and extensible. It is built on top of the following libraries:
	- [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/)
	- [Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/)
	- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
	- [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)
	- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)

Anatolio is based on Vertical Slice Architecture. This means that each feature is built as a vertical slice that includes all the layers of the application (UI, Application, Domain, Infrastructure).
